### üìå Project Title  

## Cyber-Physical Energy Management System (CPEMS) ‚Äì Load Simulation and Forecasting Platform

### üìñ Description

This project implements a cyber-physical energy management system focused on industrial load simulation and energy forecasting. It integrates MATLAB/Simulink, Python, and InfluxDB with a Streamlit interface to simulate realistic industrial load profiles, generate synthetic measurement data, and forecast future energy consumption using a GRU-based neural network model.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

Python (Streamlit, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, InfluxDB Client)

MATLAB/Simulink (Industiral load simulation with harmonics)

InfluxDB (storing and handling time-series database)

GRU Neural Network (Multi-Horizon load forecasting(Oneday/One Week))

### üß© Features
