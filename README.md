## üìå Project Title

**H1Cyber-Physical Energy Management System (CPEMS) ‚Äì Load Simulation and Forecasting Platform**

üìñ Description
This project implements a cyber-physical energy management system focused on industrial load simulation and energy forecasting. It integrates MATLAB/Simulink, Python, and InfluxDB with a Streamlit interface to simulate realistic industrial load profiles, generate synthetic measurement data, and forecast future energy consumption using a GRU-based neural network model.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Python (Streamlit, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, InfluxDB Client)

MATLAB/Simulink (for load simulation with harmonics)

InfluxDB (time-series database for storing measurement data)

GRU Neural Network (for load forecasting)

üß© Features
